# Overleaf Resume

This folder contains the LaTeX source code for my resume, which I am creating using Overleaf. 

## Files

- `resume.tex`: The main LaTeX file for my resume.
- `header.tex`: A separate file containing the header information for my resume.
- `education.tex`: A separate file containing the education section of my resume.
- `experience.tex`: A separate file containing the experience section of my resume.
- `skills.tex`: A separate file containing the skills section of my resume.
- `publications.tex`: A separate file containing the publications section of my resume.
- `awards.tex`: A separate file containing the awards section of my resume.
- `references.tex`: A separate file containing the references section of my resume.

## Building the Resume

To build the resume, I am using Overleaf's online LaTeX editor. I simply upload the files to Overleaf, and then compile the `resume.tex` file to generate the PDF output.

## Customization

I have customized the resume by modifying the header information in `header.tex`, and by adding and removing sections in the other files as needed.
