        <h3>Iluma Innovations Labs - Karn Sun
        </h3>
        <p>
          <ul>October 23rd, 2022</ul>
          <ul>karen.y.sun@gmail.com</ul>
          <ul>Recommendation for Flávia Iespa</ul>
          <ul>To Whom It May Concern</ul>
          <ul>My name is Karen Sun, Fractional CTO for the Iluma Alliance, a venture fund for life sciences research
            based in Medellin, Colombia. We hired Flávia Iespa as a Data Engineering Intern for 4 months during the
            summer of 2022 to work on data pipelines supporting gut microbiome research in several animal species.
            She was responsible for engineering tasks ranging from devops to data modeling to quality assurance to
            ETL implementation in Python. We worked in an adapted Agile methodology, observing the planning,
            retrospective, and demo rituals using GitHub Issues as our tracker and estimator.
            Since the beginning, Flá stood out as a self-starter, someone truly curious about the why and not just the
            how, a quality hard to find in typically speed prioritizing younger engineers. Before the internship began,
            she asked for a pre-work list and already started working through tutorials learning brand new skills like
            Github, SQL, and Python. </ul>
          <ul>By the time she started the internship she was already at intermediate level
            (even according to HackerRank) and moved to advanced within the first week. She also stands out as
            someone who works with rigor and comprehension– for instance, right after setting up her own
            development environment, she immediately updated the README with specific instructions for those with
            her OS, and filled in any gaps that weren’t obvious. This is an especially professional trait that can be
            hard to cultivate, but speaks to far seeing maturity.
            Flávia was able to onboard to some rather complex pipelines which clean, merge, and perform windowing
            operations on multiple data sources, interfacing directly with scientists, translating their requests into
            tickets, and delineating and breaking down the implementation work on her own. Throughout the
            internship, she never stopped asking for more to learn and practice on her own time, and by the last
            months, the scientists were going directly to her for ETL and pipeline requests! Not only is she competent,
            she is also such a cheerful, warm addition to any space. Her experience facilitating, teaching, and
            inquiring in remote settings definitely contributed to her solid foundation of connective remote work.
            Finally, she developed in certain ways which are difficult for early career engineers– she embraced
            making her work visible through early and often PRs, she learned exactly how and when to ask for a
            pointer when blocked, and built quality assurance early into her development process through data sanity
            checks and unit tests.</ul>
          <ul>Iluma Innovation Labs was very fortunate to have Flá as a team member– she possesses enormous
            dedication, participatory attitude, and work ethic. Please don’t hesitate to reach out for a reference or any
            questions. Any team would be fortunate to have Flávia as a member!</ul>

        <h3>Latin American Leadership Academy - Marcelo Peterlini</h3>
        <p>
          <ul>May 1st, 2021</ul>
          <ul>To whom it may concern,</ul>
          <ul>It is an honor to write this letter to enthusiastically endorse Flavia Iespa. I have known her for
            about two years and since the first time I met her I was already impressed with her energy and
            enthusiasm. Our first contact was through a 30 min Skype chat and after listening to Flavia’s story I
            could understand how she was able to develop such grit and determination in an early stage in her
            life. Her family never had the best financial and emotional structure to support her in the best way and
            because of that she naturally developed a level of maturity well above average for her age. She grew
            up being concerned about finding ways to support her family financially and also emotionally, playing
            the psychologist role with her mom. Whenever Flavia sets a goal for herseIf there is nothing that can
            happen that will prevent her from achieving it, she does not wait for opportunities to come to her, she
            pursues it deliberately and makes it happen, and that is how I got the privilege to meet her.</ul>
          <ul>I have been working in education and youth development for 6 years and I am currently the
            Regional Director at Latin American Leadership Academy (LALA), an educational NGO with the
            mission to identify, select and develop a new generation of young ethical and socially innovative
            leaders around Latin America. Our work is focused on developing the most promising teenagers in
            Latin America that have demonstrated leadership potential and desire to positive impact their
            communities. We do that by organizing week long intensive leadership and social impact programs,
            which we call bootcamps, to provide youth with all the tools, abilities and support to tackle the
            problems they are most passionate about. Our selection criteria for the bootcamp we ran in August
            2019 was very stringent: all applicants had to demonstrate a genuine commitment to creating social
            impact, and show outstanding servant leadership, entrepreneurial, and intellectual potential. Finally,
            they had to show mastery of English. In a way, we are trying to identify at an early stage the students
            with a passion and potential to become the next future leaders of Latin America. I was responsible for
            selecting Flavia to attend the bootcamp in Lima, Peru.</ul>
          <ul>After an intensely selective process, we selected 30 students from all over Latin America.
            Flavia stood out from the start: since she is a very charismatic, eloquent and outgoing person, she
            naturally assumed the role of a leader in most activities that were proposed during the Bootcamp,
            manifesting her strong leadership skills among the carefully selected group of young leaders. Part of
            the Bootcamp goal was to support students to identify an issue they care about in the world and start
            understanding that issue more deeply before deciding to develop an initiative that might contribute for
            the solution of it. Most students of the Bootcamp were very quick in deciding the issue they would like
            to explore, but Flavia decided to take a different route. In an environment where you gather the most
            promising young leaders in Latin America, is very common for students to pretend to have clarity
            about everything they are doing to prove to others that they were selected for a reason.</ul> 
          <ul>Although,Flavia is no ordinary person and she wasn’t worried about creating an image of herself that fit the
            expected patterns of the group, she was looking for truth and to understand what really mattered to
            her, and that says a lot about her character. One that note, Flavia impressed me with her willingness
            to share her truth and vulnerability at all times during the program, not worrying about how that would
            make her be seen by others in the group. I remember having a conversation with her where she
            opened up to me saying that she was lost and confused about the things she wanted to pursue with
            her life, next steps to be taken after going back home and not knowing who she was. For me, that
            simple act was a demonstration of her courage; courage to be vulnerable and ask for help when
            everyone around her is telling her to be strong and deal with things by yourself. It fascinates me how
            Flavia is able to use her network to help her make sense of her life and, consequently, make the right
            decisions. She understands the value of the community and is able to use hers to achieve her goals.</ul>
          <ul>I was also able to follow Flavia’s steps after the Bootcamp and was very gratifying to see her
            spreading her light to other places around the world. After going back to Rio de Janeiro, Flavia started
            to develop a podcast where she wants to bring more voice to youth to talk about all the issues that are
            happening in the world. She also applied and was accepted at our LALA Academy Program, where
            we selected some of the most promising young leaders in Latin America to attend a 3-month
            immersive leadership and social innovation program in Medellin, Colombia. There I had the chance to
            spend even more time with Flavia and was surprised by the grit and growth mindset she
            demonstrated. Her eagerness to learn is off the chart. During my six years working with education, I
            have never seen a student taking ownership of his or her learning so beautifully like Flavia. During the
            3 month program, she became very interested in understanding contemplative practices, Buddhism,
            and meditation. It was fascinating to see her commitment to growing in these three areas. Flavia
            started to attend Buddhist teachings sessions once a week at a nearby Buddhist Center, practiced
            one hour of meditation every single day in the morning prior to class, read three books focused in
            contemplative practices in less than two weeks, was constantly watching videos and reading articles
            about those topics and was looking for any opportunity she could find to refine her meditation practice.</ul>
          <ul>Today, Flavia is working with me as an intern, supporting the admissions process for the
            Bootcamps we organize. Once again, I am delighted by her professionalism and strive for excellence.
            Her main responsibility as an intern is to support me with the interview process of students who have
            applied for the Bootcamps. It stands out to me her deep care and compassion for the students. Before
            each interview, she carefully reviews every student’s application, reading, and memorizing each detail
            of it. During the interview, she is very skilled in holding a space where students can feel very
            comfortable sharing who they are. I can clearly see in her traits of a phenomenal compassionate
            leader, just by the way in which she offers attentive listening, presence and a liturgical follow up to
            student’s answers in response to her questions. After a few seasons in the admissions team, Flavia
            started to mentor new interns and, very quickly, became an inspiration and reference to them. It was
            very common to have interns sharing all the learnings they were receiving from her and the care she
            put into supporting them.</ul>
          <ul>Recently, Flávia has started to volunteer at the CVV (Centro da Valorização da Vida). Her
            main role as a volunteer is to receive calls from people who are going through depression and suicidal
            thoughts, and offer them care by deeply listening to their stories and providing words of comfort and
            support. When she first told me about that, my heart melted. This was the type of action that is a clear
            manifestation of two of the main values that I associate with her, love and compassion. She is one of
            the people I’ve worked with that can actually bring a radical transformation in society; not one that
            changes our outer world, but one that changes our inner lives through unconditional love, acceptance
            and understanding. There are very few people who are willing to have the courage to aim at
            unconditionally loving and understanding the world, and Flavia is one of the rare beings out there.
            It warms my heart to see Flavia getting closer to her truth and finding her own path into this
            world. After a long process of self-reflection, Flavia is gaining more clarity about her desire to pursue a
            career as a psychologist. I am certain that her kindness and compassionate heart will offer healing
            and clarity to any person that comes into her life.</ul>
          <ul>I am personally excited to follow Flavia’s journey, which will undoubtedly be transcendental for
            the communities she touches. I will personally ensure I stay in touch with her to support her in any
            way I can since she has the passion and potential to transform Latin America. I will be happy to
            expand on this letter through a phone call if it would help you make an informed decision. But in short,
            I reiterate that I endorse Flavia with the greatest enthusiasm and with no reservations.</ul>
          Yours truly,.</p>
